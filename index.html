    <p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <p>
      JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
    </p>
    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <p>
      Since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.
    </p>
    <p id="demo3"></p>
